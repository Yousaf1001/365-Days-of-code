#####################Approach#####################
The given code uses a backtracking algorithm to generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses. 
The backtracking algorithm is a general algorithmic technique that involves exploring all possible solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates to the solutions,
and discarding a candidate as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

##################Algroithem##################
1)we start with an empty string curr and two counters open and close initialized to zero.
We then recursively build candidates to the solution by considering two possible choices at each position:
2)We can place an opening bracket if the number of opening brackets placed so far is less than n. 
We make a recursive call by incrementing the open counter and appending an opening bracket to the current string.
3)We can place a closing bracket if the number of closing brackets placed so far is less than the number of opening brackets placed so far.
We make a recursive call by incrementing the close counter and appending a closing bracket to the current string.
4)We continue this process until we have placed 2*n brackets in total.
 At this point, we have generated a valid combination of n pairs of parentheses, 
 and we add it to the ans vector.



#################Time and Space Complexity#################
Time complexity:
For each position, we have two choices to make: either we can place an opening bracket or a closing bracket. 
So at each position, we have two recursive calls. The number of such positions is 2*n. 
Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is O(2^(2n)).

Space complexity:
The space complexity of the given code depends on the maximum depth of the recursion stack. 
The maximum depth of the recursion stack is equal to the maximum number of opening brackets that we can place before placing any closing bracket. 
This value is n. Therefore, the space complexity of the given code is O(n).

So, the time complexity of the given code is exponential in n, whereas the space complexity is linear in n.
