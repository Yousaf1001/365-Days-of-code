Sure! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
1)The code starts by defining a constant long long integer named modulo and initializes 
it to 1000000007. This is a prime number commonly used in competitive programming problems
to avoid integer overflow.
2)The code defines a recursive function named countGoodNumbersHelper that takes two long 
long integers num and power as input and returns a long long integer. This function
calculates the power of the given number using the binary exponentiation method with
modular arithmetic to avoid integer overflow.
3)Inside the countGoodNumbersHelper function, there are three conditional statements:
The first conditional statement checks if the power is equal to zero. If it is,
the function returns 1, since any number raised to the power of zero is equal to 1.
The second conditional statement checks if the power is equal to one. If it is,
the function returns num, since any number raised to the power of one is equal
to itself.The third conditional statement runs if neither of the first two conditions is 
met. This calculates the power of the given number using the binary exponentiation method,
which involves calculating the square of the number repeatedly until the power is reached.
If the power is odd, the function multiplies the result by num and takes the modulo to 
avoid integer overflow.
4)The countGoodNumbers function takes a single long long integer n as input and returns an
 integer that represents the number of good numbers between 1 and 10^n inclusive.
5)Inside the countGoodNumbers function, two long long integers oddNum and evenNum are 
calculated, representing the number of odd (5's) and even (4's) digits between 1 and 
10^n inclusive.
6)The countGoodNumbers function uses the countGoodNumbersHelper function to calculate the
power of 5 and 4, based on the number of odd and even digits calculated earlier. 
It multiplies these two powers and takes the modulo using the modulo constant defined 
earlier to avoid integer overflow.
7)Finally, the countGoodNumbers function returns the calculated product, which represents
the number of good numbers between 1 and 10^n inclusive.

##############################Time and Space Complexity########################
The time complexity of the countGoodNumbers function is O(log n), where n is the input number. This is because the function calls the countGoodNumbersHelper function recursively, and each recursive call reduces the input size by half.

The countGoodNumbersHelper function also has a time complexity of O(log n) since it recursively calculates the power of the given number using the divide-and-conquer approach.

The space complexity of the countGoodNumbers function is O(1) since it uses only a few variables to store the input and intermediate results, and they do not depend on the input size.

The countGoodNumbersHelper function has a space complexity of O(log n) since it uses the call stack to store intermediate results during the recursive calls, and the maximum depth of the call stack is log n.
